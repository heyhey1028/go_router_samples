This is a sample repository dedicated for article below regarding the use of `StatefulShellRoute`.

[link for articles]

`StatefulShellRoute` is a new feature added to `go_router` package in 2024/07, which allows us to easily implement persisted bottom navigation and persisted state of each tabs.

It'll be implemented in following steps.

1. Define `GoRouter`
2. Add `StatefulShellRoute` to it's route
3. Prepare a page with `NavigationBar` and set it as root container for `StatefulShellRoute`
4. Add `StatefulShellBranch` for each tabs
5. Add `GoRoute` for each branches
6. Set `GlobalKey<NavigatorState>` to each routes

## Sample
After a dummy signin page, sample navigates to a page implemented with `StatefulShellRoute`.

Sample consists of four tabs which holds different types of states. 

You can see how states for each tab is maintained even switching between tabs.
